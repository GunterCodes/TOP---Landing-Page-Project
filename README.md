# TOP---Landing-Page-Project
This project is the culmination of all of my HTML and CSS education to date. I started this project over a week ago and stumbled many times to get where I am now. Throughout the process I was challenged to demonstrate HTML framework skills, organizing abilities, and CSS magic (namely flex box). 

I completed this project with some help from the TOP Discord community (special thanks to Novii) and with some guidance from W3, MDN, and YouTube!

This page is in no way perfect, but I DID IT! From here, I move onward to Javascript and bigger/better pages!
